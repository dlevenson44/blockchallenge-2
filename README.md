Cryptotracker tracks Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, and Litecoin pricing information utilizing the Coin Market Cap, Kraken, and Poloniex APIs.  Built using React on Node, information is stored in a postgres database, which then feeds data through to the front-end which is displayed to the user.  Information is graphed utilizing ChartsJs.  Users can also generate their own Bitcoin Address, which includes public and private keys.  <br />
